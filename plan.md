**Note:** 
1. As per the requirements, the focus should be on high-priority features (marked as "Prioridade Alta" in the requirements document). Low-priority features can be implemented later in the development process.
2. This plan implements a front-end only solution using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript without any frameworks.
3. All data persistence and management will be handled client-side using local storage and mock data to simulate back-end functionality.
4. Future iterations could include integrating a real back-end system.
